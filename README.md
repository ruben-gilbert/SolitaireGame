## How To Play

### Windows
Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/ruben-gilbert/SolitaireGame/releases), download the most current release, unpack the zip file, and run SolitaireGame.exe.  If you win (or get to an unfinishable point in a game), push R to create a new game.

### Mac
A .app is in the works (Soonâ„¢).  If you'd like to play before then, you can [install the MonoGame framework](http://www.monogame.net/downloads/) (be sure to get 3.7+).  Then, download the Windows version and unpack the zip file.  From the command line, navigate into the resulting folder and run `mono SolitaireGame.exe`.

Developed using Visual Studio 2017.  Graphics designed using Monogame 3.7.
